<summary>üëé Bad Practice</summary>

- You do not separate instruction from context.

```markdown
Summarize the following excerpt from Emergency Response Framework guideline:

Incident management system
The grading of an emergency triggers the activation
of WHO‚Äôs IMS, which provides a standardized yet flexible
approach to managing WHO‚Äôs response. WHO applies
the IMS regardless of the underlying hazard, scale or
operational context of the emergency. The IMS approach
is internationally recognized as best practice for emergency
management.
Key concepts and principles
Standardized emergency functions. These are key
functions for any emergency response, brought together in a
unified structure regardless of the number of people involved
in the operations. For WHO, the core IMS functions are:

leadership and coordination
planning and monitoring
operations support and logistics
technical expertise and health operations
health information and epidemiology
partner coordination and engagement
finance and administration.
Flexibility, adaptability and scalability. The IMS is
applicable to all types and scales of emergencies. It can
be easily adapted as needs evolve, while maintaining
standards and predictability.
