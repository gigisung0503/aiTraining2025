### üëã Greetings

Welcome, WHE colleagues!  

In the next 45 minutes you‚Äôll learn **how a few formatting tricks can turn messy PDF excerpts into machine-ready prompts**‚Äîand why that matters for faster, safer emergency workflows.

## 1  Why this session?

* LLMs are powerful, but they can‚Äôt **guess** structure.  
* WHE workflows often start with PDFs, scans, or emails ‚Üí *unstructured*.  
* A tiny dose of ‚Äúcomputer language‚Äù (Markdown & friends) **cuts hallucinations and rework**.



## 2  Session road-map

1. Prompt-formatting fundamentals
2. Hands-on lab
3. Advanced prompting teaser
4. Quiz & wrap-up

*(You can jump via the table of contents at right.)*

## 3  Prompt Formatting  


### 3.0  The golden formula

> **Instruction + Context + Output spec**   ‚Üí   Success


</br></br></br>

### 3.1  Use delimiters like ``` to separate the instruction and context

- Suppose you want to summarize a text from a pdf.

- In many cases, you will either
    - Drag and drop the pdf file.
    - Copy and paste the text. 
- And give an instruction like "Summarize the text."



#### Try for yourself.

Incident management system
The grading of an emergency triggers the activation
of WHO‚Äôs IMS, which provides a standardized yet flexible
approach to managing WHO‚Äôs response. WHO applies
the IMS regardless of the underlying hazard, scale or
operational context of the emergency. The IMS approach
is internationally recognized as best practice for emergency
management.
Key concepts and principles
Standardized emergency functions. These are key
functions for any emergency response, brought together in a

### 3.2  Use the hierarchy: Heading, subheading, list, and footnotes

- Whether you:
    - Attach pdf, jpeg, and docx files
    - Drag>Copy>Paste content
- GPT will struggle comprehending the hierarchy of the document.
- üëç Articulate the hierarchy by adopting **markdown** grammar. 

- You can use markdown "to add formatting elements." 
- [Markdown grammar](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/):

```markdown
# Heading level 1 
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
and so on...

- List  

[^1]: Footnote  
```

# Incident management system

The grading of an emergency triggers the activation of WHO‚Äôs IMS, which provides a standardized yet flexible approach to managing WHO‚Äôs response. WHO applies the IMS regardless of the underlying hazard, scale or operational context of the emergency. The IMS approach is internationally recognized as best practice for emergency management.

## Key concepts and principles

Standardized emergency functions. These are key functions for any emergency response, brought together in a unified structure regardless of the number of people involved in the operations. For WHO, the core IMS functions are:

- leadership and coordination
- planning and monitoring
- operations support and logistics
- technical expertise and health operations
- health information and epidemiology
- partner coordination and engagement
- finance and administration.

Flexibility, adaptability and scalability. The IMS is applicable to all types and scales of emergencies. It can be easily adapted as needs evolve, while maintaining standards and predictability.

Interoperability. The IMS allows WHO to interact and work more effectively with operational partners. This includes functional interoperability (for example, use of standardized terminology and procedures) and technological interoperability (for example, standardized telecommunications). Interoperability is also promoted through WHO‚Äôs adherence to interagency protocols and procedures.

## Activation of the IMS

Within 24 hours of grading, WHO will:

- ensure the safety and security of all staff;[^28]
- appoint an incident manager in country (and at regional and headquarters offices as required) for a minimum
initial period of three months;
- establish an incident management team (IMT) in country to cover critical IMS functions, which will be done
initially through repurposing of country office staff, alongside ministry of health and field partners;
- activate the emergency SOPs;
- establish contact with government officials, partners and other relevant stakeholders;
- determine the need for surge support to the country for critical IMS functions. This determination is made
following an assessment of country office capacity to manage the emergency during the grading call. Surge support may also be needed at regional office and headquarters;
- begin the deployment of surge support on a no regrets basis, as needed;
- designate an interim PSEAH resource person;
- elaborate the initial response objectives and action plan, until a more detailed plan is developed;
- establish an incident management support team (IMST) at regional and headquarters levels to mobilize and coordinate Organization-wide and partner support
- for Grade 2 and Grade 3 responses. The structure of IMSTs can vary, but always supports the in-country IMT functions as required. A focal point will be appointed at regional level, and if necessary, at headquarters level, to provide any required support for Grade 1 emergencies.



[^28]  Ensuring the safety and security of staff is an ongoing activity and does not depend on grading.

### 3.3 Translate tables and graphs (advanced)

- GPT is bad at interpreting tables and graphs. 

- Especially when there are **merged cells** in a table, and **complex legends** in a graph. 
  
- For the most accurate interpretation, you need to **translate the tables and graphs** into computer language.



#### üíª Tables? Use HTML

#### Try for yourself.
<iframe src="data/ERF_table.pdf#navpanes=0" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>

1. Tell chatgpt to recreate the *Table 2*.
2. Check if all the elements are included:
   1. Title
   2. Number of rows and columns
   3. Column names
   4. Footnotes
3. A merged cell is rarely recognized.

<details>
<summary> üëç [Table 2](data/table.html) translated into html:</summary>
```{html}
<h1>Table 2. Organizational responsibilities and accountabilities for emergency response operations</h1>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th rowspan="2">Grade</th>
      <th colspan="3">Responsibilities</th>
      
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Technical and operational support</th>
      <th>Operational oversight</th>
      <th>Accountability*</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>
        - IM at country office<br>
        - As needed: IMST in regional office
      </td>
      <td>Delegated to RED</td>
      <td>Regional Director</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>
        - IM at country office, and IMST in regional office<br>
        - As needed: IMST in headquarters
      </td>
      <td>Delegated to RED</td>
      <td>Regional Director</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>IM and IMSTs at three levels</td>
      <td>Delegated to RED or Director WHE/headquarters</td>
      <td>Executive Director of WHE or Regional Director**</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

--- </br>

* The Executive Director of WHE, on behalf of the Director-General, is operationally accountable for all emergency responses. Regardless of grade, the Executive Director of WHE has the delegation of authority to intervene under any circumstances that he or she may deem appropriate. </br></br>

** To be agreed by the Executive Director of WHE and the Regional Director(s) within 48 hours of grading. For events where the Executive Director of WHE is accountable, operational oversight lies with a Director WHE/headquarters, to be specified depending on the type of event. For events where the Regional Director is accountable, operational oversight lies with the Regional Emergency Director.

#### üìà Graphs? Use code

<iframe src="data/penguin.jpg" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

species = ("Adelie", "Chinstrap", "Gentoo")
penguin_means = {
    'Bill Depth': (18.35, 18.43, 14.98),
    'Bill Length': (38.79, 48.83, 47.50),
    'Flipper Length': (189.95, 195.82, 217.19),
}

x = np.arange(len(species))  # the label locations
width = 0.25  # the width of the bars
multiplier = 0

fig, ax = plt.subplots(layout='constrained')

for attribute, measurement in penguin_means.items():
    offset = width * multiplier
    rects = ax.bar(x + offset, measurement, width, label=attribute)
    ax.bar_label(rects, padding=3)
    multiplier += 1

# Add some text for labels, title and custom x-axis tick labels, etc.
ax.set_ylabel('Length (mm)')
ax.set_title('Penguin attributes by species')
ax.set_xticks(x + width, species)
ax.legend(loc='upper left', ncols=3)
ax.set_ylim(0, 250)

plt.show()
