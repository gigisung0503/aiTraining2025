### üëã Greetings

Welcome, WHE colleagues!  

In the next 45 minutes you‚Äôll learn **how a few formatting tricks can turn messy PDF excerpts into machine-ready prompts**‚Äîand why that matters for faster, safer emergency workflows.

## 1  Why this session?

* LLMs are powerful, but they can‚Äôt **guess** structure.  
* WHE workflows often start with PDFs, scans, or emails ‚Üí *unstructured*.  
* A tiny dose of ‚Äúcomputer language‚Äù (Markdown & friends) **cuts hallucinations and rework**.



## 2  Session road-map

1. Prompt-formatting fundamentals
2. Hands-on lab
3. Advanced prompting teaser
4. Quiz & wrap-up

## 3  Prompt Formatting  


### 3.0  The golden formula

> **Instruction + Context + Output spec**   ‚Üí   Success


</br>

### [3.1  Use delimiters like ``` to separate the instruction and context](31.qmd)

> **Quiz**
> 
> *You separate instruction from context by using ________________.*
>
> <details><summary>Answer</summary>delimiters</details>

### [3.2  Use the hierarchy: Heading, subheading, list, and footnotes](32.qmd)

> **Quiz**
> 
> *You use ______ to indicate heading levels.*
>
> <details><summary>Answer</summary> # </details>

### [3.3 Translate tables and graphs (advanced)](33.qmd)

> **Quiz**
> 
> *ChatGPT struggles to recognize a ____________ cell in a table.*
>
> <details><summary>Answer</summary> merged </details>


### 3.4 Wrap-up

> <mark>**"Give ChatGPT an ah-hah moment by formatting messages with their language."**</mark>
> 
> ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Use a delimiter like """ to separate the instruction and context
>
> ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Use a hierarchy: Heading, subheading, list, and footnotes.
>
> ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Translate tables and graphs


## 4 Beyond Formatting: </br> Well-known Prompt Engineering Techniques 

### 4.1 Divide up long context

> "We've observed very strong performance at complex tasks with a mix of relevant and irrelevant code and documents **in the range of hundreds of thousands of tokens**[^1]." 

- **Token**‚Üí**Word**: 1 token ‚âà 0.75 English words
- **Word**‚Üí**Page**: 1 page ‚âà 300 words (wpp = words per page)
- ‚Äúhundreds of thousands of tokens‚Äù ‚Üí 250‚Äì750 pages

### 4.2 Place instruction at the top and the bottom

> "In our experiments, we found that **it was optimal to put critical instructions, including the user query, at both the top and the bottom of the prompt**; this elicited marginally better performance from the model than putting them only at the top, and much better performance than only at the bottom[^2]."

- Performance: </br> Instruction at both **the top and the bottom** > Only at the **top** > Only at the **bottom**

### 4.3 Place chain-of-thought instruction at the end of prompt

> "First, think carefully step by step about what documents are needed to answer the query. </br>
Then, print out the TITLE and ID of each document. </br>
Then, format the IDs into a list[^3]."

- Divide up instruction step by step and place it at **the end of prompt**.

### 4.4 Start with Zero-shot and then Few-shot

‚úÖ Zero-shot

Extract keywords from the below text:

```
# WHO‚Äôs Role During Health Emergencies
As the health lead for the United Nations, a primary responsibility of the World Health Organization (WHO) is to respond to natural disasters and disease outbreaks. This role includes supporting countries in building their national capacities and advocating for preparedness, developing strategies and global response plans for health emergencies, and providing operational response activities.

```

### 4.5. Articulate the desired output format through examples

‚úÖ Without output format 

````markdown
Extract the entities mentioned in the text below. Extract the following 4 entity types: company names, people names, specific topics and themes.

```
{Context}
```

````


‚úÖ With output format 

````markdown
Extract the important entities mentioned in the text below. First extract all company names, then extract all people names, then extract specific topics which fit the content and finally extract general overarching themes

Desired format:
Company names: <comma_separated_list_of_company_names>
People names: <comma_separated_list_of_people_names>
Specific topics: <comma_separated_list_of_topics>
General themes: <comma_separated_list_of_themes>

```
{Context}
```
